Objective 
This take-home exercise assesses your ability to define a product vision, rapidly prototype a 
solution using AI coding tools, and document it effectively. We want to see your ability to 
leverage emerging technologies to build and communicate product ideas. 
Scenario 
We are working with a leading car insurance company to help them assess damage to cars as 
part of the claims process.  
Your task is to design and build a basic prototype of an AI-powered car insurance claims 
experience that increases efficiency and accuracy at a lower cost to the insurance company.  
Existing workflow 
Assume this happens before our solution 
●  Initial Claim Report: 
○  Policyholder contacts the insurance company (phone, website, app) to report an 
accident. 
○  A claims agent gathers basic information (policy number, accident details, etc.). 
●  Damage Documentation: 
○  Policyholder is instructed to submit photos or videos of the vehicle damage. 
This is the flow we want to automate 
●  Manual Review and Assessment: 
○  Claims agents manually review the submitted photos/videos. 
○  They assess the extent of the damage (scratches, dents, structural damage). 
○  They use their experience and knowledge to estimate repair costs. 
○  They sometimes consult standardized repair cost databases or manuals. 
●  Estimate Generation: 
○  The claims agent generates a detailed estimate of the repair costs. 
●  Approval and Authorization: 
○  The estimate is reviewed and approved by a senior claims adjuster. 
○  Authorization is given to proceed with repairs at an approved repair shop. 
Assume this happens after our solution 
●  Repair Process: 
○  Policyholder takes the vehicle to the repair shop. 
○  The repair shop may conduct its own assessment and provide an estimate. 
○  The repair shop and the insurance company will negotiate the final price. 
●  Final Inspection: 
○  After repairs are completed, a final inspection may be conducted to ensure 
quality. 
○  The claim is then closed. 
Your task 
1.  Prototype 
○  Using an AI coding tool (e.g., Replit, Lovable, Cursor, v0, Bolt.new), create a 
functional prototype demonstrating the core user flow for a claims agent. 
○  The prototype should include: 
■  A basic user interface for initiating a claim. 
■  Functionality to upload an image of the vehicle damage. 
■  A simulated (AI-generated) response, such as a preliminary damage 
assessment or next steps. 
■  While complete AI functionality is not required, the prototype should 
demonstrate how AI could be integrated into the claims process. 
○  You can mock the AI response if you’d like but make sure to describe the 
approach you would take in the PRD.  
○  Provide a link to a Github repo of the prototype as well as a recorded demo.
